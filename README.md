# reZonator 2

[reZonator](http://rezonator.orion-project.org) is software for designing of laser resonators and calculation of light beam propagation (as gaussian so as ray vectors) in complex optical systems. 

This is the official port of reZonator to [Qt](qt.io) framework. The goal is to make it open-source and cross-platform.

Currently, version 2 is in alpha state, but it implements the most important functions of version 1:

* Reading of project files (schemas) from version 1.
* Stability calculation for resonators (standing-wave and ring).
* Caustic calculation for resonators and single-pass systems.


See [Home page](http://rezonator.orion-project.org/index.php?page=ver2) or [Releases](https://github.com/orion-project/rezonator2/releases) for binary packages for Windows, Linux and macOS. See [build instructions](./docs/build.md) for building from source code.
