Thermal Lens
============

.. |n0| replace:: `n`\ :sub:`0`
.. |n2| replace:: `n`\ :sub:`2`

The thermal lens has a quadratic transverse variation of refractive index, with either a maximum or minimum on the axis that produces a lensing effect.

This element is entirely similar to :doc:`ElemGrinLens`, however instead of setting gradient constant |n2|, you can explicitly assign focal range `F`, and gradient constant is calculated using the :doc:`../calc_grin` tool.

The element is cylindrically symmetrical and doesn't imply differences between tangential and sagittal planes.
