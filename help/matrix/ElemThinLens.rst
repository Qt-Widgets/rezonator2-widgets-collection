Thin Lens
=========

Thin lens has no parameter of thickness, index of refraction of glass is not taken into account, and beam propagation inside of lens body is not computed.

Lens can be collecting or diverging (positive or negative) depending on the sign of focal range.

Lens has the same focal ranges *F* for both tangential and sagittal planes. Matrices for both planes are also equal when the beam falls on the lens at the normal angle. But when incident beam inclines at angle *Î±*, then matrices for T and S planes differ.

Thin lens acts exactly like :doc:`spherical mirror <ElemCurveMirror>`, except that you have to specify the focal range instead of the radius of curvature.
