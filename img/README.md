# Images

## `./_tmp`
Images used as shape sources, some obsolete images, or images moved from rezonator-1 but not used yet.

**TODO:** Should be eliminated. Move used images to respective dirs and delete unused ones.

## `./drawing`
Images that are used as tips/infos/descriptions in the application.

## `./elem`
Element drawings and icons.

## `./icon`
Images that are used as window header icons.

## `./misc`
This dir should contain images that are nor toolbar glyphs or window icons.

## `./tips`
Images displayed at start window in Tips section.

## `./toolbar`
Images mainly intended to be displayed in toolbars buttons and push buttons.

They can be `svg` images of any sizes (128x128, 512x512), but they should look fine even at small scales - 16x16, 24x24.

## `./toolbar16`
Images optimized for 16x16 size only. They are shown in menus or small buttons.

## `./toolbar10`
Images optimized for 10x10 size only. In some places we need images even smaller than 16x16.
